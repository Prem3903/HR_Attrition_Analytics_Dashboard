# HR Analytics Dashboard - Insights and Observations

This README file provides insights and observations derived from the HR Analytics Dashboard image. The dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of key HR metrics, focusing on attrition analysis and employee demographics. 


## Key Metrics and Trends

**1. Overall Attrition:**

* **Attrition Rate:** The overall attrition rate is 16%, indicating a significant portion of employees leaving the company. This warrants further investigation to understand the underlying causes.
* **Attrition Count:** A total of 237 employees have left the company.
* **Average Age:** The average age of employees is 37 years.
* **Average Salary:** The average salary is 6.5K (units not specified, but likely currency).
* **Average Working Years:** Employees have an average tenure of 7 years.


**2. Attrition by Gender:**

* The dashboard clearly shows a breakdown of attrition by gender, with a significantly higher number of male employees leaving compared to female employees. **Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind this disparity.**

**3. Salary Analysis:**

* **Salary Slab Distribution:** The "Salary Slab" section shows the distribution of employees across different salary ranges, with the majority falling within the "Upto 5k" range.
* **Attrition by Salary:** The bar chart "Sum of Attrition Count" indicates the number of attritions in each salary slab. 
    * **Insight:** A significant number of attritions are occurring in the lower salary brackets ("Upto 5k" and "5k-10k"). This suggests that compensation might be a contributing factor to attrition among lower-paid employees.

**4. Education and Attrition:**

* **Attrition by Education:** The donut chart reveals the proportion of employees in different education categories and their respective attrition rates.
    * **Insight:** "Life Sciences" and "Medical" categories have the highest representation, but the "Technical Degree" category shows a higher attrition rate (14%). This could indicate that employees with technical degrees have better outside opportunities.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
